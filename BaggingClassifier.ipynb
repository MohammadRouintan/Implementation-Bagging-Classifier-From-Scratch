    "### Bagging\n",
    "Bagging is an abbreviation of Bootstrap Aggregating. The conventional bagging algorithm involves generating $n$ different bootstrap training samples with replacement. And training the algorithm on each bootstrapped algorithm separately and then aggregating the predictions at the end.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bagging is used for reducing Overfitting in order to create strong learners for generating accurate predictions. Unlike boosting, bagging allows replacement in the bootstrapped sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "This ensemble methodology produces a stronger compound classifier since it combines the results of individual classifiers to come up with an improved one.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advantages**:\n",
    "* Improves stability & accuracy of machine learning algorithms\n",
    "* Reduces variance\n",
    "* Overcomes overfitting\n",
    "* Improved misclassification rate of the bagged classifier\n",
    "* In noisy data environments bagging outperforms boosting\n",
    "<!-- end of the list -->\n",
    "\n",
    "**Disadvantages**:\n",
    "* Bagging works only if the base classifiers are not bad to begin with. Bagging bad classifiers can further degrade performance\n"
